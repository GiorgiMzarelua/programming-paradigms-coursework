# Programming Paradigms - CS206004

Course assignments from the Programming Paradigms course (CS206004) at Free University of Tbilisi, covering multiple programming paradigms and fundamental computer science concepts.

## Course Overview

This repository contains implementations across different programming paradigms:

* **Procedural Programming** (C)
* **Object-Oriented Programming** (C++)
* **Functional Programming** (Scheme)
* **Dynamic Programming** (Python)

The course also covered concurrent programming concepts in lectures.

**Note:** Assignments 5 and 6 were skipped by the lecturer during this academic year.

## Assignments

| # | Title | Language | Key Concepts |
|---|-------|----------|--------------|
| 1 | **Random Sentence Generator** | C++ | Context-free grammars, recursion, memory management |
| 2 | **Six Degrees of Separation** | C++ | Graph algorithms, BFS, binary file parsing |
| 3 | **Custom Vector and HashSet** | C | Generic programming, hash tables, function pointers |
| 4 | **RSS News Search Engine** | C | Web scraping, inverted index, networking |
| 7 | **Where Am I? - Trilateration** | Scheme | Functional programming, geometric algorithms |
| 8 | **DNA Sequence Alignment** | Python | Dynamic programming, Needleman-Wunsch algorithm |

## Technologies & Tools

* **Languages:** C, C++, Scheme (Kawa), Python
* **Build Tools:** Make, GCC
* **Testing:** Valgrind, custom test suites
* **Libraries:** libcurl, STL

## Learning Outcomes

* Low-level memory management and system programming
* Custom data structure implementations

* Functional programming principles
* Real-world applications: web scraping, bioinformatics, search engines

## Building and Running

Each assignment has its own build system and instructions. Navigate to the specific assignment directory and refer to its README for details.

```bash
cd assn-XX
# See individual README for build/run instructions
```
